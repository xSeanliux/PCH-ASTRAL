-   desc: Probable effects of dialect networks.  
    data: 
    - 15 blood  Latvian (and eastern Lithuanian dialects) preserve the PIE word, while standard Lithuanian and Old Prussian exhibit an innovation that should originally have meant ‘gore’. Since the dialect chain was OPrus. – Lith. – Latv., it looks like the innovation might have spread from west to east through dialects in contact.  
    - 46 fear  a perfect with the reconstructable meaning ‘be upset’ has come to mean ‘fear’ in Celtic and Germanic.  But that might reflect very early dialect contact, and the other Germanic state is clearly an innovation.

    - 163 suck  the distribution of state 16 might reflect very early dialect contact.  
    - 171 thick  the state shared by Germanic and Celtic might reflect dialect contact.  
    - 204 worm  the anomalous initial consonant shared by Germanic and Latin might reflect very early dialect contact.  
    - 206 year  the state shared by Germanic and Latin might reflect very early dialect contact.  
    - 301 arm  ‘joint’ has clearly encroached on ‘arm’, but the fact that it did so in Germanic and Old Prussian might reflect dialect contact.  
    - 310 beard  the distribution of state 5 might reflect very early dialect contact.
